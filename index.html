            An Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) is a geographic information system used for nautical navigation that complies with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations as an alternative to paper nautical charts.

            style="background-color:grey ;">Uses of ECDIS</p>
        </h2>
        <P>
         ECDIS provides          continuous position and navigational safety information. The system generates audible and/or visual alarms when the vessel is in proximity to navigational hazards. Military versions of ECDIS are known as WECDIS (warship ECDIS) or ECDIS-N (ECDIS-naval).
        </P>
        <P>
            The amended SOLAS regulation V/19 requires all newly built passenger ships of 500 gross tonnage and upwards, as well as newly built cargo ships of 3,000 gross tonnage and upwards engaged on international voyages to be fitted with ECDIS.

        </h2>
<P>
    An electronic navigational chart or ENC is an official database created by a national hydrographic office for use with an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS).

        Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC), also known as vector charts, are data sets to support all types of nautical navigation

               Source Error -
                An electronic chart can be as good as the original data it was derived from. Position shift : There will be position shift shown between GPS and actual position on the chart if the GPS and the chart are using different datum's.

                1. Lack of Global coverage 
                </h3>
                <p>
The lack of official ENC makes things just worse. Even if a number of Hydrographic Offices have started ambitious programs of ENC production, very few official electronic charts in S-57/3 format are available today. The result is that ECDIS users have to supplement ENC data with non-ENC electronic charts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is an electronic device so, it take time to get back at normal if there is any sudden power loss.
